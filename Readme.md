# My personal website (Revamped!)

During my third year I recognized that I wanted to revamp my website with some of the stuff I've learned over the past year. I set out a couple of objectives: create a back-end so I could dynamically add a blog and projects page that could easily be updated in the background.

Some of the tools I used to accomplish this project: React (using hooks!), Node.js, Next.js, Express, Postgresql.

This project was intended to take a couple weeks but ended taking a lot longer because I did not set out clear objectives. (Blog post on this comming soon!)

## Features

* A landing page with a basic bio on me.
* A projects/portfolio page listing all my projects.
* A blog with custom slugs and SEO, server side rendering, and markdown to make the posts look nice.
* A user system to access a dashboard to add/edit/delete blog posts and projects.
